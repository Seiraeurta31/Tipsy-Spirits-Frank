“Tipsy Spirits” is a fun app, designed for those who like to enjoy a variety of different cocktails whatever the occasion! Inspiration for this application came from personal experience visiting bars and restaurants, where I’ve struggled to find something on the menu that fits the style drinks I usually enjoy, leaving me to settle for a drink I may not enjoy or going with the “usual” default drink. On the flip side, when hosting a party or gathering with friends, I often find myself lacking the knowledge and creativity of knowing which fun drinks to create for my guests, resulting in the typical boring basic bar options. Tipsy Spirits is designed to empower the user by providing access to a large database full of new ideas and recipes allowing for creativity at the palm of the hand. 

The theme name and theme of the site is meant for a fun spin on the phrase "tipsy" and "spirits" for both cocktails and a haunted feel. I have seen a few examples of this type of app before but nothing with this theme which makes it fun and unique. The following is a mock-up I created to help visualize the desired end result for this program.

The application starts with a basic home screen with the option to log in or sign up. From there, the user is welcomed with a user dashboard where they are offered a daily recipe to try along with options to view favorites, search for new ones, and log out. When a user choses a recipe to view, they will be shown details including the name of the recipe with a picture of the drink (if available), ingredients, the type of drink (a.k.a"alcoholic"), and instructions. To acomplish this, I used “thecocktaildb.com” API by signeing up for my own personal API Key to unlock more options/features for my application. This API offers the option to search by id, name, ingredient, type, and at random. 

The database and hosting platform used to execute this application is MongoDB and Vercel. I included environmental variables as well for an added layer of protection (including IRON PASS, API_KEY, and MONGODB_URI). These have been stored in the .env.local file locally, and added to the platform for deployment.
